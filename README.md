JavaScript Code Along - Flashlight 404 error starter and finished files

### RabbitWerks.js
---

This is a simple code-along using HTML5 CSS3 and Javascript to re-create a 404 Error page much like the Skillshare website's 404 page.
Feel free to peek at the finished files then try to re-create it yourself, or follow along in my video where I break down this project step by step from the beginning.
